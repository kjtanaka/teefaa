How to scale
============

Cloudmesh Teefaa is designed to provision Operating System one by one.
However, scale matters.

We believe easy-to-use is easy-to-adapt. We resolve the issue of scale
by using another piece of easy-to-adapt software. Specifically, TORQUE 
Resource Manager works for us fine, and use Cloudmesh Teefaa as batch jobs.

There are multiple solutions for scheduling tasks on multiple worker nodes.
So please pick one which suits you best.
