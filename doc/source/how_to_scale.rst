How to scale
============

Cloudmesh Teefaa is designed to provision Operating System one by one. 
However, scale matters.

We recommend a batch scheduler for provisioning of multiple nodes.
We use Torque Resource Manager, but there are multiple solutions in this area.
So please pick one which suits you best. 

Here's the list of software which you may want to look into.

1. `Torque <http://www.adaptivecomputing.com/products/open-source/torque/>`_
2. `Slurm <http://slurm.schedmd.com/>`_
3. `Supervisor <http://supervisord.org/>`_
